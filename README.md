This project is a Student Result Management System, a full-stack web application designed to streamline the process of managing and viewing student results. Built using Python with the Flask framework, it integrates a MySQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval. The system provides user authentication and role-based access control for students, teachers, and administrators, ensuring secure access to relevant information. Teachers can directly input student marks through a dedicated interface on the website, which are then securely stored in the local MySQL database, simplifying the marking and data entry process. With a focus on usability, the application features a responsive interface for easy navigation and data management. This project demonstrates skills in database management, backend development, and frontend design, offering a practical solution for educational institutions.
